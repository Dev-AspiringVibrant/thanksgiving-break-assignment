                        Ghana celebrates Thanksgiving through <strong>Homowo festival</strong>. Homowo festival is paying tribute to the Ga tribe's ancestors during a famine centuries ago. During the time Ga tribe arrived on Ghana's coast, the soil was not fertile and there was no rain for a long period of time. When rain happened, the Ga people had a loud celebration for the huge blessing of food. In translation, <em>Homowo</em> means hooting at hunger which represent the Ga people during the famine. In addition to their tradition, Ghana's capitical city of Accra enforces a noise ban for a month to reflect on the Ga people who died in the famine time including fishing in the lagoons to represent the lack of food. After a month, the noise ban is lifted following with church service honoring the deceased and servicing special dishes which includes a cornmeal called <em>kpokpoi</em>.
